# Creation of intelligent agents to simulate different player profiles. Application to the card game Â¡Toma 6!
This is my Final Degree Project in Computer Engineering with a final grade of 9.5, the game "Take 6!" has been replicated, using the Python language and with libraries such as PyGame and TensorFlow, creating a personal database with data from automatic games between medium and hard difficulties.

These are the 4 difficulties that have been created: 
- Random. (Easy)
- Decision tree. (Medium)
- MonteCarlo Tree Search. (Hard)
- Neural Network. (Expert)

If you want to generate the executable you just have to use the command "pyinstaller main.spec" and if you want to create another database you have to uncomment the line 128 in "controller.py".
